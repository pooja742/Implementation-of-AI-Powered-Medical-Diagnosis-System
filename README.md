# Implementation-of-AI-Powered-Medical-Diagnosis-System
## HOW DO YOU RUN THIS PROJECT???
### STEP-1:
first download the respective folder named Project2_files from my repository named Implementation-of-AI-Powered-Medical-Diagnosis-System
### STEP-2:
create a new folder(e.g. new_project) on your desktop... and paste the downloaded Project2_files file into it......now in this same newly create folder(new_project) we need to create an ENVIRONMENT which is must and should to run our project
### STEP-3:
to create an environment... open cmd from this new_project folder and type the below to create an python environment -- 'python -m venv project2'.
it wil take sometime and successfully install all files like scripts, lib, etc in ur project2 newly created environment
### STEP-4:
after setting up the environment... we should make sure that we run all the .ipynb files and save the new models of them...after we run all .ipynb files and save the .sav models along with the updation in app.py...we must download all these and replce wid the existing ones which we hv already in the folder previously...(this is a very headche task as we need to hv jupyter notebook and need to install many modules,libraries , dependencies, etc...but trust me patience is all it takes!! ;)
### STEP-5:
after all new models are saved again in folder... now get back to the terminal(new_project)
and type -> .\project2\Scripts\activate 
next it wil get enter into (project2)
then type : cd .\Project2_files\
it will now enter into Project2_files dir
again type : cd '.\Medical diagnosis using AI\' (path to enter the Medical diagnosis using AI folder)
### STEP-6:
finally after u enter the Medical diagnosis using AI dir
TO RUN THE PROJECT RUN THE COMMAND -----> streamlit run .\app.py (this wil redirect u to the local host where u can get access to our project)
#### if still any errors or issues then ask the chatGpt to resolve it...if there are any module issues then it might be u not installing streamlit properly...just ask the chatgpt againn and again at last it wil give a solution for sure...be patient
